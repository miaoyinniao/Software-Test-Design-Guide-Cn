One came from Yogita Sahoo, who agreed that ET can be useful, then asked, &quot;But can we get others to agree on such an unplanned process?&quot; Ms. Sahoo’s question raises some very important issues, such as: <br></span><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">What is &quot;planning&quot;?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Is exploratory testing necessarily unplanned?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Why might we need to do things that aren’t rigorously planned?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">How do we coordinate and support each other, if not with a plan?</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Here’s my short answer: Exploratory testing (ET), as I practice it, usually proceeds according to a conscious plan. But not a rigorous plan. Rigor requires certainty and implies completeness, but I perform exploratory testing precisely because there’s so much I don’t know about the product and I know my testing can never be complete. Exploratory testers coordinate with each other and gain support in the same way executives run large companies: by talking with each other and building credibility over time. It’s not rocket science, except that rocket scientists and all scientists also use exploratory tactics in their work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>Exploratory testing may well be planned…</b></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> <i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i> offers us four definitions of &quot;plan&quot;:</span></p><ol><li>A scheme, program, or method worked out beforehand for the accomplishment of an objective; e.g., a plan of attack<i>.</i></li><li>A proposed or tentative project or course of action; e.g., had no plans for the evening<i>.</i></li><li>A systematic arrangement of important parts; an outline or a sketch; e.g., the plan of a story<i>.</i></li><li>A drawing or diagram made to scale showing the structure or arrangement of something; e.g., the ventilation plans show two intake vents.</li></ol><p>Notice that a plan can be a plan without necessarily being a specific, rigorous, complete, or recorded plan. Thus, one answer to Ms. Sahoo’s question might be that good exploratory testing <i>is</i> a planned activity, even though it’s not <i>scripted in detail</i>. I find it useful to define a test plan as &quot;the set of ideas that guide the test process.&quot; This definition is consistent with at least the first two <i>American Heritage</i> definitions. In order to guide testing, the test plan must exist before the testing, but how long before? What if it comes into existence only moments before the testing? No problem. Nothing in the notion of planning prohibits simultaneous planning and execution. In football, when quarterbacks find that their receivers are too well covered, they may quickly make a new plan to run with the ball. An instant later, they execute the new plan. Thinking fast is no crime against plankind.</p><p><b>…but learning comes before the plan…</b></p><p>Still, I may be missing Ms. Sahoo’s point. Another meaning of the planning question could be &quot;How can we get others to agree on a process with such an open-ended and unpredictable plan?&quot; To address that issue, it helps to invoke the most rigorous, repeatable activity you can imagine. Perhaps playing a flawless piano concerto. Now ask yourself, is there a plan in that activity? I would have to say yes. Now ask yourself, what happened <i>before</i> that plan existed? I would have to say some kind of rigorous composing and practicing process. Now, was that <i>prior</i> process guided by the same rigorous sort of plan? I suspect not. If we keep peeling back the layers of how things originated, we soon get to processes that obviously were not rigorously planned. There was a time before the choice was made to play that piece, or even learn the piano. Were those choices made according to formula, or were they subject to exploratory processes? For that matter the evolution of music, musical notation, the design of the piano, and methods of teaching piano all have evolved in nonrigorous ways.</p><p>Anything explicitly planned must have arisen from a less explicitly planned activity at some point in history. ET is exactly the kind of activity that comes before rigor and makes rigor possible. ET is primarily creative. It has value because it exposes problems, but it also has value because it is a way to create other kinds of tests. It’s a great way to learn about a product. And rigorous test plans start with thorough understanding of the product. That gives us an answer to the planning question: an open-ended plan may be all that we have. If you already know <i>for sure</i> what the next test is that would be worth executing, by all means follow that plan. Otherwise, you’ll have to figure that out for yourself. And that’s an exploratory process.</p><p>You get someone to agree to such a process the same way you get someone to agree to allow a house to be built before they try to live in it. If they understand the difference between a house and an empty lot, and they want a house, and they see that there is no house, they may well agree that someone ought to build one.</p><p><b>…and dealing with a complex world requires skill, above all.</b></p><p>Still another way to think about Ms. Sahoo’s question is that it’s a query about how a relatively lightly planned activity can be organized and managed. This is where the myth of planning really rears its head. The truth is, we organize and manage all kinds of things without detailed plans. In the absence of pre-scripted moves, what do we do? We pay attention. We react to the situation at hand. We anticipate problems. Because we don’t always know the right answers in advance, we have developed ways to come up with answers on the fly.</p><p>Similarly, we can train testers to excel safely in exploratory testing: start small, provide coaching, learn from failure, and build on successes. I don’t send testers on complex exploratory missions until they have gained credibility on the easier missions. Testers must show an ability to design a good test strategy, execute good tests, find important problems, and report them in a compelling way. Furthermore, they must be able to explain their work. Only under those conditions do I come to trust a tester’s exploratory work.</p><p>Remember it’s the skill of the tester, the social system of the project team, and the testing situation at any given moment that enable excellent exploratory testing. Don’t dwell too much on planning. If you’re challenged to defend exploratory testing on the basis that it’s not planned, reply that when the developers let you know where all the bugs are, you will happily write a precise and accurate plan that visits each one. Until then you must spend some of your time exploring in order to find important bugs fast.</p><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-weight: bold;"><a name="authorbio">About the Author</a></span><br style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">James Bach is the founder of <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/" target="_blank">Satisfice, Inc.</a>, a test training and consulting company.

I agree that while testing continues as per planned work,ET also keeps coming in the way.Usually when i plan to start my one round of testing with all my defined testcases i usually firsr like to do an ET just to get a hand on AUT. This gives me an idea of not being repeatitive and also helps me find some defects which are because of some kind of flows which has not been written in my testcases.<br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1%"> </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="98%"><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"><br><a name="#4703"><b>Comment:    </b></a><br><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: transparent;"><i>by vamsi krishna 3/12/2006</i></span><br><img src="13.5 参考_files/Image [12].gif" type="image/gif" height="4" style="cursor: default;" width="1"/><br>
Nice article to explore the exploratory testing in turn.But i truly believe in that exploratory testing is the inherent part of all kinds of testing as it is all about exploring some forbidden dungeons in the application under test.So it could occur any time in the testing.So still i wonder why exploratory testing needs a separate identity when it become the inherent part in the testing processing itself.Personally i never stared ET with the intention of doing Exploaratory testing and i truly belive in that intuition and out-of-box thinking helps a lot in testing which we may call exploratory testing.<br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1%"> </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="98%"><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"><br><a name="#179"><b>Comment:    </b></a><br><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: transparent;"><i>by Mahesh Balachandran 4/4/2001</i></span><br><img src="13.5 参考_files/Image [13].gif" type="image/gif" height="4" style="cursor: default;" width="1"/><br>

Dear James, An excellent thought provoking article. Thanks for bringing out some of the basic needs of a tester. Your definition of a good tester is re-assuring. We assist our clients in testing their internet apps using tools. Most often, we follow a set pattern and I am sure your article will help us put the ET perspective for our clients. ET testing, I feel is part of any testers' life cycle and the challenge before the QA group is to try and break the software. Planned scenarios may not cater to this need always. Classic examples are null values in a number field in the olden punch cards! <br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1%"> </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="98%"><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"><br><a name="#158"><b>Comment:    </b></a><br><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: transparent;"><i>by jim wachter 3/21/2001</i></span><br><img src="13.5 参考_files/Image [15].gif" type="image/gif" height="4" style="cursor: default;" width="1"/><br>
I like to think of exploratory testing as pulling at loose threads. At my company we create test plans that both serve as a road map for testing and define when we're done. (I always have way more possible tests then I'll ever be allowed to attempt. The test plan is negotiated down from there.) We execute all the planned tests and I encourage my testers to pull on all the loose threads. Once all the planned tests pass, all the loose threads have been pulled, and everything retested - then we're done. When pulling threads you have to have enough discipline to stop before the either arm falls off however.<br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1%"> </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="98%"><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"><br><a name="#157"><b>Comment:    </b></a><br><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: transparent;"><i>by Joseph Telafici 3/21/2001</i></span><br><img src="13.5 参考_files/Image [16].gif" type="image/gif" height="4" style="cursor: default;" width="1"/><br>
Well-written article on a difficult topic. I always precede exploratory testing with 30-60 minutes of loose planning. I'll jot down the major test categories (functional, stress, performance, compatibility, etc) and write a couple of test ideas within those categories to probe that about which I currently know least. When I'm exploring later, I'll run those tests, and go off on tangents when the first set of tests expose areas that might be problematic. Aside from generating good data for test case planning, it helps validate schedule assumptions made in the early stages of a project.

At my firm we are in a rapid-development phase, with release A in test while programmers have their eyes on release B and their hearts on release C. That would not be too terribly bad, except that release A arrived at QA in a &quot;slush&quot; rather than a &quot;frozen&quot; form. I'm sure there is a world out there where all the specs and use cases happen first and are completely refined and perfected before programming starts, and where &quot;code freeze&quot; is religiously observed, and where a rigorous testing approach with a deeply-documented plan and lots of little boxes to fill in would be the best way to go; but I don't work in that world.

Hi James, Thank you for the convincing and promising article. You have really EXPLORED the several meanings that my question tried to represent.I certainly agree that planned activities don't necessarily have to be scripted. But it certainly has to be a pre-thought out process. May be you are thinking just 1 minute ahead of your action, but thinking certainly helps. As I had written in my previous comment, testers perform ET subconciously, and so do I. When I tried to scrutinize the process, I found that there is always a little bit of planning or sort of back-ground processing, prior to my action.<br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="1%"> </td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="98%"><span style="font-size: 12px; background-color: transparent;"><br><a name="#153"><b>Comment:    </b></a><br><span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: transparent;"><i>by Chris DeNardis 3/19/2001</i></span><br><img src="13.5 参考_files/Image [19].gif" type="image/gif" height="4" style="cursor: default;" width="1"/><br>
In regards to the question asked, I believe that most test managers think a plan is set in stone. When it comes to exploratory testing, in this case, it is a &quot;living plan&quot; that could change as more loop holes are unturned. One should be organized in the plan so as to give direction to the testers about to execute the area. There should also be a predefined time limit to this exploratory testing. Subject to change if a lot of problems are found - of course.<br><br></span></td><td bgcolor="#E6ECF5" width="1%"> </td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=ART&amp;ObjectId=2359#top" style="font-size: 11px; color: rgb(0, 51, 153); background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none;">Back to Top</a></div><br></div></div>
